## ds_classify_instruments: Convolutional neural network for identification of musical instruments.
This repository is about implemetation of VGG16 for classification of musical instruments for the custom-made data set. First the network architecture is built from scratch and trained. Next, to boost acccuracy transfer learning is used for different number of trainable layers. Accuracy of 90% is achieved for both validation and test split.
